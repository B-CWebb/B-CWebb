Hi! My name is Brandon Webb. 
As a current undergraduate pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, I am deeply passionate about leveraging my blend of technical expertise and collaborative skills to tackle intricate challenges within the realm of computer hardware and system design.
Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my abilities to grasp complex technical concepts and apply them in practical scenarios.
I am driven by a curiosity for the inner workings of computer systems, and I thrive in environments that encourage continuous learning and hands-on experience.

My commitment to collaboration is reflected in my ability to work effectively within interdisciplinary teams. 
I believe that the most impactful solutions arise from diverse perspectives coming together to address multifaceted problems. 
This collaborative mindset has been further developed through my coursework and leadership roles in organizations across the University of Oklahoma. 

As I embark on the exciting journey of merging theory with real-world applications, I am eager to explore opportunities that allow me to contribute to groundbreaking projects and innovations within the field of computer engineering. 
Open to networking and learning from seasoned professionals, I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals who share a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology and solving the challenges of tomorrow.
